This is a very lightweight bare-metal OS for the STM32F407VGT6(no libraries or external headers, only C) that includes a simple font renderer and LCD driver(Elegoo 2.8in TFT LCD), ps-2 keyboard drivers, a simple file system(128kb of flash accessible for now) and also a simple assembler you can use to run programs you write on the dev board.
